# BG-project
This is my first Machine Learning Project that uses my own data from a Minimed Medtronic insulin pump (CSV file in repository) to predict if my blood glucose will fall within a certain target range.
I used the following classification algorithms: linear regression, logistic regression, kNN, decision tree, random forest, naive Bayes. 
kNN had the best results.
